# ðŸ§ª TypeScript In-Memory Storage & Debounce Utility

## ðŸ“¦ Overview

This repository includes two standalone TypeScript modules, implemented with SOLID principles and full static typing:

1. **In-Memory Storage** â€” a lightweight store for `{ id: string; tags: string[] }` objects with filtering by `id` and `tags`.
2. **Debounce Utility** â€” a fully typed debounce function supporting `wait` and `forceNext()` options, preserving `this` context and written without modifying built-in prototypes.

The code is modular, testable, and production-ready.
